float is a jQuery plugin that makes an input field only allow a float or integer value.

* Only allow numerics, decimals and tabs on specified fields.
* Prevent input other than numbers and a single decimal character. 
* Doesn't prevent using control keys like shift and arrow keys for selecting and copy/pasting.
* Makes sure selecting, deleting, cut/copy/paste, undo, etc still work as expected.
* Optionally specify a precision to limit how many characters can be entered after the decimal.
